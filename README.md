## Features

This repository is to open-source the library that's used in my [Unity Android Bluetooth Low Energy](https://github.com/Velorexe/Unity-Android-Bluetooth-Low-Energy) plugin under the `Assets/Plugins/Android/unityandroidble.jar`. To not make everything secret or closed-sourced, this repository contains the Java side of things, for transparency sake, but also for people who want to expand on the project and add other custom commands.

## Compiling

fthiemer: Compiling the application to a `.jar` is removed. You can add the functionality back in, by following instructions in app/build.gradle.
